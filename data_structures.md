## Hash Tables 

Hashing is a way of storing data that in an average case scenario allows for constant time storage and retrieval.
This can be achieved by using an array.

Hash Table Operations:

- Insert
- T [h(“john”)] = <“john”,25000>
- Delete
- T [h(“john”)] = NULL
- Search
- T [h(“john”)] returns the element hashed for “john”

Hash tables support fast insert and search:

- O(1) average case performance 
- Deletion possible, but degrades performance 
- Not suited if ordering of elements is important
- Many applications

## Binary Trees 

## Tries

## Balancing Binary Trees (AVL Tree)
