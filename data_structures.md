## Stack 
A stack is a linear data structure used to store a collection of objects.The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). Items can be added and stored in a stack using a push operation. And can be retrieved using a pop operation, which removes an item from the stack. When an object is added to a stack, it is placed on the top of all previously entered items. When an item is removed, it can either be removed from the top or bottom of the stack. A stack in which items are removed the top is considered a "LIFO" (Last In, First Out) stack. 

Big O(n)

## Queues
A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue, we remove the item the least recently added.
Queue is also an abstract data type or a linear data structure, just like stack data structure, in which the first element is inserted from one end called the REAR(also called tail), and the removal of existing element takes place from the other end called as FRONT(also called head).
